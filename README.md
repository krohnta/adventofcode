### Advent of Code

I have no idea what I'm doing, but thanks to [@scy](https://github.com/scy/advent-of-code), I just stumbled upon [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). 

It looks quite scary, and I'm not sure whether I can motivate myself enough to get through, however, I cannot say I never tried :)

 

2019-11-24: To anyone more experienced than I am, my code must look like a complete mess, however, I found examples where people copied their input directly into the code instead of reading it via file. It seems I'm not as bad as I had expected (though of course I needed to google how to read in a file in Python – at least, in the meantime, I don't only read it but transform it directly into the wanted data structure with RegEx etc.).
My main issues are definitely in the 'how can I do such a thing in Python?' – well, not that I'd know how to do it in any programming language… – and less in the 'I don't understand the problem' department. And there's the issue that I'm familiar with big-O notation, so I *know* that my solutions are inefficient but do not have the ability to improve this. Yeah, well. Keep calm and carry on. And every now and then, stumble upon a shortcut handling stuff in a more elegant way (while not being the kind of elegant that I don't understand).
