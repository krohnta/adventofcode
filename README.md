## Advent of Code
I have no idea what I'm doing, but thanks to [@scy](https://github.com/scy/advent-of-code), I just stumbled upon [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). 

It looks quite scary, and I'm not sure whether I can motivate myself enough to get through, however, I cannot say I never tried :)

### Mood and Motivation Tracking

2019-11-24: To anyone more experienced than I am, my code must look like a complete mess, however, I found examples where people copied their input directly into the code instead of reading it via file. It seems I'm not as bad as I had expected (though of course I needed to google how to read in a file in Python – at least, in the meantime, I don't only read it but transform it directly into the wanted data structure with RegEx etc.).

My main issues are definitely in the 'how can I do such a thing in Python?' – well, not that I'd know how to do it in any programming language… – and less in the 'I don't understand the problem' department. And there's the issue that I'm familiar with big-O notation, so I *know* that my solutions are inefficient but do not have the ability to improve this. Yeah, well. Keep calm and carry on. And every now and then, stumble upon a shortcut handling stuff in a more elegant way (while not being the kind of elegant that I don't understand).


2019-11-30: One week, and I've gotten 22 points so far for 2015. And now I'm really getting to the point where I don't understand the problem (i.e. day 7 with logic gates and bitwise operations) or have an idea about a useful data structure but don't understand how to handle that structure (i.e. day 16 with Aunt Sue where I'd like to use dictionaries - I understand the theory but I have serious issues in implementing even reading the input data).

I guess I'll pause 2015 for now and wait for 2019 to begin tomorrow morning.

2019-12-07: Work takes its toll, and while I often got to read the puzzle in the morning, I did not have the time to think about it during the day. And in the evenings, there was other stuff to do or I was already too tired to think about anything anymore. However, today I wanted to get day 3, part 2 to work (after lots of trial and error during last week's evenings), and it took me almost an hour of fiddling around with my code until I needed to google some Python functionality – and then notice that I have no internet access. Enjoy the little things :) And yes, that code is still far from enjoyable. I should probably do more list comprehension.

2019-12-19: Current challenge at work would be to get some basic knowledge in Java (well, wanted to learn object-oriented programming anyway, so there's that), however, all those intcode puzzles were quite demotivating for me because of the abomination I used to solve the first intcode puzzle on day 2. Today, I was finally able to refactor day 2 to make it extendable to day 5, part 1, and even though I can see the room for improvement regarding my code, at least, I got another star. So currently, I have two things to decide between: basic Java during the next three weeks (so until my vacation ends) and more Python with AoC. I tend to focus a bit more on the Java stuff because this would force me to use object-oriented programming which might improve my Python later. And the current AoC puzzles are way over my abilities anyway (I do understand the problems but I have no clue how to implement any of the solutions).

2019-12-28: Due to a spontaneous case of overconfidence, I started AoC 2016 – in Java. Well, day 1 got me one star, and while it took me about one hour to get the correct solution, I'm not even sure if I should be proud that my main issues were algorithm-related (i.e. off-by-one errors, wrong directions due to wrong order of expressions). And of course, it is not very object-oriented (apart from what Java provides and enforces).
